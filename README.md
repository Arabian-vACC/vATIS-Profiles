# Arabian vACC - vATIS Profiles
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Arabian Virtual Area Control Center (vACC), dedicated to the creation and maintenance of **vATIS profiles** for use within the VATSIM network. This repository provides open-source resources that help standardize and enhance the delivery of automated terminal information across airports in the Arabian vACC region.

vATIS profiles are essential for ensuring that controllers can deliver consistent and accurate ATIS broadcasts, including details such as weather conditions, runway configurations, and operational notices. These profiles are tailored to individual airports and are designed to be used with the **vATIS application**, streamlining the process of setting up and updating ATIS broadcasts in both text and voice formats. Youâ€™ll need the latest version of vATIS to enable automatic profile updates.

As an open-source project, we encourage contributions from the VATSIM and flight simulation communities. Your input is welcome. Keeping these profiles updated ensures pilots receive the most accurate and current information, which is vital for operational efficiency and realism on the network.

Please note that familiarity with the **vATIS application** and its profile formatting is required to contribute effectively. If you are new to vATIS, we recommend reviewing the official documentation or seeking guidance from experienced users before making edits or additions.

While this repository is maintained under the Arabian vACC umbrella, please be aware that **technical support for the vATIS software itself is not provided** by the vACC operations team. This project is entirely community-driven, and contributors are expected to collaborate and troubleshoot any issues independently or with the help of fellow users.

We look forward to your contributions and hope this repository will serve as a valuable resource in improving the quality, consistency, and realism of ATIS broadcasts across the Arabian vACC. Let's continue working together to elevate the virtual flying experience for everyone!
